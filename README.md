#React Tour of Heroes

This is an implementation of Angular 2's [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/toh-pt1.html) tutorial application, but built in React for comparison. This project uses [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) as a quick framework for getting started, so check out [React Slingshot's docs](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot) for a full overview of the React stack involved.

I built this as part of my research for this post: [Angular versus React: There Will Be Blood]()

For comparison, check out the [Angular 2 version](https://github.com/coryhouse/angular-2-tour-of-heroes).

##Get Started
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`
